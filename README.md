mmo minesweeper

## IDEAS

- ✅ hitting a mine only damages a region of the board instead of game over
- ensure even distribution of mines using procedural noise vs random placement

## TODO

- ✅ multiplayer (duh)
- ✅ perf optimize drawing board (reuse graphics, shared BG color)
- ✅ put app online
- ✅ scope grid updates to player viewport
- even _more_ memory efficient grid representation
- ✅ lose (hitting mine does something)
- ✅ BUG: can't reveal square after flagging
- ✅ mobile support
  - ✅ scrolling
  - ✅ setting mines
- mine chain-reactions?
- 🚧 minimap?
  - minimap gets bigger when moving?
- victory!
- game reset
